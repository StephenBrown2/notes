Tribeca has managed to find the right balance of great New American cuisine and exceptional service in a warm, cozy atmosphere and all at a surprisingly low price point.

The cuisine is eclectic and largely created with locally-sourced ingredients from a wide variety of Texas farms and ranches that Tribeca proudly displays on their website. The dishes are nothing short of divine. Where else will you find a dish made of brussel sprouts, crispy house-made pancetta, pecorino, rosemary vinaigrette and a poached farm egg that can so easily become an obsession? Other favorites include the Oven-Roasted Lockhard Quail with asparagus and wild mushroom risotto and Seared Scallops, perfectly cooked, with butternut squash risotto, sauteed spinach and lemon butter sauce.

Arcade Midtown Kitchen is that rare and wonderful find in San Antonio. Not only do they source their ingredients locally whenever possible, which isn't too difficult when inspiration lies right outside their front door at the Pearl Brewery's Farmer's Market every Saturday, but they do something else even more extraordinary. Arcade knows how to artfully showcase the farm-fresh ingredients and flavors that they use. Executive Chef and owner, Jesse Perez, has a passion and great respect for his ingredients, such as the Diamond H Texas free-range quail he procures from nearby Bandera, Texas. Arcade's delectable Americana cuisine is influenced largely by Chef Perez's South Texas upbringing as well as his exposure and experience working with Southern, Californian, Mexican and Italian cuisines. Ahead of the curve, Arcade's appreciation for farm-to-table is not only about quality but about the relationships being built with the local farmers. Prepare for some divine dishes! ((210) 369-9664)

Wed-Sun 11am-3pm
The Kitchen at Sandy Oaks Olive Orchard, located just south of San Antonio, is truly something to behold! Both the cuisine and the property are nothing short of majestic, but that's to be expected when the majority of ingredients are grown and picked exclusively for the restaurant. Besides the orchard, Sandy Oaks also maintains an olive tree nursery and an impressive garden filled with an unimaginable bounty. Chef Cook brings his expertise and farm-to-table mentality, what he calls farm-to-fork, to the Kitchen. It's easy to see this Chef and Orchard were meant for each other. The menu is inspired by the freshest seasonal ingredients available in the garden. Olives are, of course, artfully-integrated into the dishes. The new summer menu features a thoughtful array of fresh salads, soups and entrees, such as the Gulf Shrimp Scampi made with local zucchini, squash noodles and heirloom tomato. Dessert is also a must! The house made Olive Oil Cake with seasonal berry coulis is unbelievably moist and the Olive Oil Ice Cream is unexpectedly yummy. For those wishing to have this old world charm and serenity all to themselves can rent out this exceptional South Texas destination for a wedding or any other special event ((210) 621-0044)
